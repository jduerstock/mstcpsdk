This is a simple windows program that demonstrates windows sockets 
library UDP commands.  You need to have the entry "local_node"  with 
your IP address in your hosts file.  This program uses hard coded ports 
1025 and 1026.

To run it: after loading the application in windows, click on Options 
(the only menu choice). Then click on UDP_commands.  You should see 
the following 4 lines of output:
    Starting UDP sample application
    sent packet 
    received packet from IP addr=???.???.???.???
    End of UDP sample program.

If you wish to modify this program, first modify the makefile (winudp.mak)
if necessary, and then remake with pvcs make:
   make -f winupd
